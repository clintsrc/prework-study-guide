# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide is the first project for bootcamp students to explore the fundamentals of web development. Its purpose is to prepare students right away for deeper learning when the class begins. It ensures a working development environment and introduces fundamental topics at a high level.

The Prework Study Guide serves as a notebook to help capture essential notes on the areas of study from the lesson: HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.

The tools used to create the project were: vscode, git, and browser developer tools. The project was setup in GitHub from scratch and best practices were followed for issue tracking, code branching and PR merges. The browser console was used to log JavaScript function output and to help with script debugging.
